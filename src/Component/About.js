                <p>I started my coding journey while obtaining my associate degree in computer
                    science. After finishing my degree, I was self studying web development for 
                    a year. I decided to join a coding bootcamp to further my skills as a 
                    web developer. By attending a coding bootcamp, I was able to work on several projects using
                    frontend and backend technologies.
