                <p>Hello!, I started off my coding journey as a self-taught developer. After a few months of self-teaching, I decided to join a coding bootcamp as a Full Stack Web Developer.
                    Currently, I am a recent graduate that have experience using front-end and back-end technologies. I love learning and I'm always open to learn new things.
